## Stand with Hong Kong

This is an open source app and yet it can serve the purpose of keeping track of visit history.

All data is stored locally and none of your personal data is being collected.

The very existence of this app exposes the lies of the Hong Kong government that such an app cannot be developed.

## We really fuxking love Hong Kong!!
Hong Kong is the home we love the most, it is now our turn to do something after escaping to the free world!

1. Launch the payment gateway <a href="https://freehk.io" target="_blank">FreeHK.io</a> to replace HKMA, so that the Chinese government can no longer use the wealth of Hong Kong people to do their evil bidding
2. Set up a non-governmental organisation aimed at promoting and educating consumers to avoid all Made in China products
3. Replace businesses across the free world which support the evil communist China regime with companies willing to stand with Hong Kong
4. Lobby in various countries to confiscate assets and to deport the family members of government officials
5. Establish Hong Kong government in-exile to prepare for taking over Hong Kong in the near future
